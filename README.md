# BSRvsNucSimilarity
Plots the BSR and nucleotide similarity after n generations.

This program plots the values of Blast Score Ratio and nucleotide sequence similarity in an interval of n generations, under a specific mutation rate.

-i "Input query file with one nucleotide sequence"
-r "Input reference file with one nucleotide sequence"
-n 'Number of generations passed between each calculation of BSR and nucleotide similarity.'
-c 'Number of BSR and nucleotide similarity calculations.'
-m "Mutation Rate"
